# Validation with JSON Schema

All fab4m forms can generate a JSON Schema from their definition.
This is very useful when you want to validate your form data on the server side.

## Generating a JSON Schema

Consider the following form:

```jsx
const form = createForm({
  username: textField({ required: true, validators: [minLength(5)] }),
  age: integerField({ label: "Username" }),
  city: textField({
    required: true,
    validators: [allowedValues(["Gothenburg", "Stockholm"])],
  }),
  vegetarian: booleanField({ label: "Vegetarian" }),
  interests: textField({ label: "Interests", multiple: true, minItems: 2 }),
  profession: group(
    { label: "Profession" },
    {
      workplace: textField({ label: "Workplace" }),
      label: textField({ label: "Label" }),
    }
  ),
});
```

This data behind this form is quite complex to validate manually, luckily we don't have
to, we can generate a schema for it and use that schema for validation instead.

Fab4m provides the `generateSchema`function to generate a schema for any form:

```jsx
import { generateSchema } from "@fab4m/fab4m";
generateSchema(form);
```

This generates a schema that can be used by a JSON schema validator:

<Schema />

Notice that:
* The validators we defined above (minLength and allowedValues) on our components are part of the schema.
* The interests multiple field is interpreted as an array.
* Our group component is properly translated to an object inside of the schema.

## Generating a schema for each form part

If you have forms with multiple parts you might need to validate each part in
isolation.

```jsx
import { generatePartSchemas } from "@fab4m/fab4m";
const schemas = generatePartSchemas(form);
```

This will give you an array of schemas, one for each form part in your form.

## Using your schema

Fab4m doesn't provide a JSON Schema validator of it's own, you are free to choose
any validator you like. The [AJV validator](https://ajv.js.org/) for javascript is an
excellent choice in js environments.

## When is this useful?

Having a JSON schema readily available for any form means that you can always validate the input from any form anywhere where you can parse a JSON schema.

## A note about rules and variants

Fab4m provides advanced features in the form of [Rules](/docs/guide/rules)
and [Variants](/docs/guide/variants). We generate a schema based on the
data when using these features to avoid generating very complex JSON
Schemas. Check documentation on rules and variants to see how it works.
